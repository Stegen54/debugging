  <h1>Debugging HTML</h1>

      “Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place. So if you're as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it?”

  <p>This HTML isn't doing what we want. Let's figure out why. Before jumping in, ask yourselves three questions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>What do I expect this code to do?</li>
    <li>What does it <em>actually</em> do and is it different than what I expect?</li>
    <li>If it's different, how can I figure out what's wrong?</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Welcome To The Team!</h2>
  <p class="green">
    This paragraph should have <strong>green</strong> text. Does it?
  </p>
  <p class="red">
    This paragraph should have <strong>red</strong> text. Does it?
  </p>
  <p>
    This paragraph should have an image in it. Does it?
    <img alt="Welcome to the team!" src="images/welcome.gif"/>
